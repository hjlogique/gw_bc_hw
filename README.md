## Student: HENRY JEAN LOGIQUE
## Assignment: Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc. website

This website represents the Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc. company which provides solution in the areas of Search Engine Optimization, 
Online Reputation Management and Social Media Marketing. The website currently has only one webpage. The background color of the website is 
white and the sections are in blue with white texts. The layout of the website starts with a banner (header) on top with a blue background and 
white text. It includes the title of the company on the left and the navigation bar with three links on the right. Each link scrolls down to
a related article or sub-section in the main area. Under the banner there is a very large background image (Hero image) of four people around
a table discussing a project. Then comes the main section of the website on the right. It contains three separate articles or sub-sections, 
which are stacked on top of each other. Each article includes a title and a paragraph, and an image next to them. Next to the main area, there 
is a narrow vertical section on the right with three sub-sections on top of each other with no divider. Footer is the last section at the bottom 
of the page. It has a white background and black texts.
