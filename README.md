GW CODING BOOTCAMP
HOMEWORK 1: Code Refactor   
Due date: Saturday, 08/15/20 Midnight Eastern Time (ET)
Student: HENRY JEAN LOGIQUE
Subject: Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc. website

This website represents the Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc. company which provides solution in the areas of Search Engine Optimization, 
Online Reputation Management and Social Media Marketing. The website currently has only one webpage. The background color of the website is 
white and the sections are in blue with white texts. The layout of the website starts with a header on top with a blue background and white 
text. It includes the title of the company on the left and the navigation bar with three links on the right. Each link scrolls down to a 
related article or sub-section in the main area. Under the header there is a very large background image (Hero image) of four people around
a table discussing a project. Then comes the main section of the website on the right. It contains three separate articles or sub-sections, 
which are stacked on top of each other. Each article includes a title and a paragraph, and an image next to them. Next to the main area, there 
is a narrow vertical section on the right with three sub-sections on top of each other with no divider. Footer is the last section at the bottom 
of the page. It has a white background and a black text.


In this homework assignment, I accomplished the followings:

    - Corrected and organized the HTML and CSS codes, and added comments  
    - Applied the HTML5 Semantics, following a sequential order and a logical structure
    - Fixed a broken link in the navigation bar
    - Applied alt and aria-label attributes to the images in HTML code, and increased the text font size 
      to follow the Section 508 and Web accessibility standards
    - Removed all unnecessary classes and attributes in the codes and made them more efficient
    - Added new features to improve the site like, mouse over effect for navigation links and applying 
      the ClearFix for the main content, so that the content can rescale as the browser rescales
    - Added title and meta data descriptions, so that the website is optimized for search engines
    - Described the project in this Red Me document
    - Uploaded the updated files to my personal GitHub repository, and made the URLs to 
      my deployed application, and my GitHub repository available
